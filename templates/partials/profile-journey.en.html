<h1 class="corinthiago">Professional Journey</h1>
<p class="profile-text">
  My professional journey is shaped by transformation – strategic, organizational, and cultural.
  From plant engineering to enterprise programs, I have consistently helped organizations rethink, realign, and renew their ways of working.

<p class="profile-text">
  I’ve led major shifts in systems, roles, and structures — from ERP implementations to cross-site portfolio setups and operational excellence programs.
  In doing so, I translate ambiguity into clarity, resistance into alignment, and vision into execution.
  I’m most effective where transformation must become reality — with focus, rhythm, and resilience.

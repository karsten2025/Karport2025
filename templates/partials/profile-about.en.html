  <h1 class="corinthiago" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">About Me</h1>
  <h2 class="profile-subtitle">1. Positioning & Mindset</h2>
  <p class="profile-text">
    My value isn’t tied to a title – it’s in how I help others see differently, connect meaningfully, and act with
    purpose and value.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    In many things I do, I hold one premise:<br>
    Reality is not what we observe, but what we co-create through action.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    My work is therefore not about managing people, projects, or plans – it’s about shaping shared sense, mutual
    traction, and reliable progress.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I orchestrate environments where products, projects, programs and portfolios can generate meaningful outcomes.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    My focus is not only on management – but on integration, alignment and emergence.
  </p>

  <h2 class="profile-subtitle">2. Bridging Perspectives</h2>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I build bridges – where connection and shared direction become possible.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I operate at the intersection of technical depth, organizational complexity, and human dynamics.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    Whether I support strategic transformations or facilitate team dialogues – my role unfolds when translating between
    perspectives becomes meaningful and valuable to others.
  </p>

  <h2 class="profile-subtitle">3. Enabling Execution</h2>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I enable flow, structure, and momentum – when impact needs to become tangible.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I don’t force action. I design the conditions that invite it.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    When organizations face ambiguity or inertia, I help create clarity of next steps, rhythm in delivery, and stability
    under pressure.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    My tools: systems thinking, executional discipline, and calm presence.
  </p>

  <h2 class="profile-subtitle">4. Resonance & Value</h2>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I don’t offer one-size-fits-all. I offer resonance.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    The real value of working with me unfolds when context, readiness, and ambition align.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    I perceive what's essential – adapt without compromise – and stay aligned with the true goal.
  </p>
  <p class="profile-text">
    My contribution becomes visible when we solve something complex – together, with intent and respect.
  </p>
